## About Me
Currently working as an SAP Operation Clerk at Real Canadian Superstore, where I manage inventory corrections and processes using data. This experience has sparked a strong interest in data science and inspired me to pursue university studies in the field.

I hold a diploma in Video Game Design & Development from Toronto Film School, where I developed a passion for creative problem-solving, collaboration, and building efficient systems. Now, I'm applying those same skills to data-focused challenges as I grow my technical foundation in Python and version control.
